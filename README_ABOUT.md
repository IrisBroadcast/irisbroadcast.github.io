# ACIP – AUDIO CONTRIBUTION OVER IP
ACIP is an EBU standard that is the basis of the IRIS Codec Call Monitor, 
ACIP outlines a few protocols and adds more specific profiles to be used in audio broadcast. 
ACIP is based on a range of IETF protocols for realtime communications – SIP, RTP, SDP and more. 
These protocols are very generic and there are several industry forums that have produced more specific reference profiles, 
like the SIPconnect specification for SIP trunking, created by the SIP Forum.

ACIP was created by a working group in the European Broadcast Union. From the introduction:

> “This document is intended to support EBU-members in the technology of audio over IP systems in audio contribution. It covers basic IP computer and network technologies and proposes suitable protocols for streaming audio over IP. Terminals for audio over IP are now common in radio operations for streaming radio programmes over IP networks. The units are used to create contribution circuits from remote sites or local offices into main studio centres. The IP networks used are usually well-managed corporate networks with good Quality of Service (QoS) and usually high bandwidth. Due to its availability, the Internet is also increasingly used for various cases of radio contribution, especially over longer distances. However, the use of high bit rates and reliable contribution transmissions over the Internet cannot be guaranteed. Correspondents have the choice in their equipment to use either ISDN or the Internet to deliver their reports. More than 20 manufacturers provide equipment for audio over IP applications.” 

The working group has concluded it’s work and  there are three documents published:
