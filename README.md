# Welcome ([GitHub Project frontpage](http://github.com/irisbroadcast))
IRIS Broadcast is a project founded in Sweden to publish Open Source software for professional radio broadcast. Our hope is that you'll find it useful. Possible even contributing to future development. These applications are used in a 24/7 365 broadcast environment. The first application we published is the [IRIS Codec Call Monitor](README_IRIS.md).

Right now we have the following applications available:

# [IRIS Platform: Codec Call Monitor, CodecControl, Connect](README_IRIS.md)

# [Ophrys Signage](ophrys/README.md)

# [Larkspur EmBER+ Provider](larkspur/README_LARKSPUR.md)

# Availability - Free to use, modify and put in production
The IRIS Platform is licensed using an Open Source license (BSD 3-Clause License). Libraries used in the code might contain different licenses. The license will mean that IRIS Broadcast can be freely used in your production, also giving you the rights to modify the software as you wish. We want to build a strong community surrounding the different applications and invite you to participate!

## Going forward
There is some general design goals we try to maintain.
- Think modules and services doing one thing very well instead of a lot of things poorly. Simplicity and easy to maintain.
- Enable scaling, both in terms of redundance and in load balancing.
- We operate in an environment of trust, so authentication and encryption should be put in place everywhere we can. But also keeping in mind that, it needs to be simple to use.
- People with different levels of programing knowledge contribute and use the system, don't make it difficult to read, maintain and understand the code. Comment freely.

## Goals
- One of the next steps is converting the CCM Project in to .NET Core. So that it could fully be runned in a Linux environment.
- Improving documentation and posting example installations.

## How to
Post questions, bugs and feature requests in the issue tracker for the corresponding project. We are a passionate team that would like to help you get started!
