# THE SOFTWARE – IRIS CODEC CALL MONITOR

The IRIS Broadcast Platform is a management software for live broadcast using ACIP-compatible codec equipment in a professional radio environment.  A versatile and extensible solution based on many years of experience and thousands of hours of live radio produced.

## Platform-independent user friendly user interface

Built with the user in focus, IRIS Broadcast delivers a lot of flexibility in a graphical user interface built to support a professional broadcast production. Delivered as a web-based application, the monitor can be used on many devices – from mobile units to wall displays updated in real time.

## Modular design 

The platform consists of several modules that together support the contribution network. IRIS Codec Call  Monitor and IRIS Discovery are the management platforms. IRIS Connect is the companion SIP server configuration for the Kamailio Open Source SIP server.

## Free to use, modify and put in production

The IRIS Platform is licensed using an Open Source license. We are working on finding out which one, based on the libraries used in building the software. The license will mean that IRIS Broadcast can be freely used in your production, also giving you the rights to modify the software as you wish. We want to build a strong community surrounding the platform and invite you to participate!
